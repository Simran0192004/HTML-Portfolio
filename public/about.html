<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Simran Singh. I am a 2nd year Computer Science Engineering student at Kalinga Institute of Technology. I am currently learning Full Stack Web Development. I just finished a course on HTML and that's how I built this project- My portfolio website.</p>
<p>My hobbies are reading, writing and basically everything that allows me to paint itself with my creativity.</p>
